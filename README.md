In this repository, we'll integrate the Node.js File Upload mechanism where users can make a gallery and soon it'll be a clone for Instagram.

### How it's working?
1. Routing is done in `Router.js` inside source file.
2. On `Home.js`, the section are divided into `Navbar`, `userProfile`, `posts` & `footer`
3. On `posts` section, `postCardMin.js` is imported and needs to be mapped when the Node.js server is integrated.
4. Responsiveness is also already completed.
